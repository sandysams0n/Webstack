				Successful people are readers

				It's because high achievers are keen on self-improvement. Hundreds of successful executives have shared with me the books that have helped them get where they are today. Need ideas on where to start? Titles that have repeatedly made their lists include:

				<li>The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz</li> 
				<li>Shoe Dog by Phil Knight</li>
				<li>Good to Great by Jim Collins</li>
